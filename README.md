# lab06-city-explorer
By Adam Owada

This is a server deployed on Heroku at https://adamowada-301-city-explorer.herokuapp.com/

It uses the City Explorer front end at https://codefellows.github.io/code-301-guide/curriculum/city-explorer-app/front-end/

For now it just uses fake data in two json files, darksky.json and geo.json, to emulate api requests. The final version will use a weather api and location api.

For Lab 06 I had help from, and collaborated with:
- Lesley Rivera
- Natalie Sinner
- Richard Whitehead

We had help from our instructor, John Cokos, and our TA Anastasia Lebedeva.
