# lab06-city-explorer
### By Adam Owada
### Version 1.0.0

### Overview

This is a server deployed on Heroku at https://adamowada-301-city-explorer.herokuapp.com/

It uses the City Explorer front end at https://codefellows.github.io/code-301-guide/curriculum/city-explorer-app/front-end/

For now it just uses fake data in two json files, darksky.json and geo.json, to emulate api requests. The final version will use a weather api and location api.

### Getting Started

Visit the City Explorer front end, use the deployed server at Heroku, and type in anything as the api key.

### Architecture

Node.js, Express
